## Speaking at PyCon MY 2025

We want **YOU** at our PyCon.

Share with us your cool hacks, Python-related projects, or your experience at learning Pyhon!
Our active and friendly community of Python developers at Malaysia are excited to hear from you.

We are excited to see the rise of adoption of Python in Malaysia and we hope that this conference will help further promote its use in the region.
We believe that sharing knowledge and ideas is the key to growth and innovation.

Join us in this exciting event and be part of the community to drive innovation in Python development!

## General Guidelines

To submit a successful proposal, we would like to share some proposal guidelines to increase the chance of acceptance.

These are the criteria that we will use to evaluate your proposal:

* Topic
* Target audience
* Audience takeaway
* Session time organisation

Your proposal should include:

* Title
* Category
* Language
* Abstract
* Objectives

These optional fields help a proposal:

* Detailed description
* Outline
* Supplementary
* Code repository link (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

These fields are for reviewers only, so you can keep your document spoiler free.

* Objectives
* Outline
* Supplementary

## Proposal Review Process

The Proposal Review begins after the closing the Call for Proposals.

The selection process will culminate in decisions being announced to all proposers on **28 September 2025**.

During the submission period, we will communicate with proposers to seek clarification or suggest edits that could improve their proposals before the final evaluation period.

### Call for Proposals System

PyCon MY 2025 will conduct the Call for Proposals through [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/).

## Tips on Designing Your Proposal

### Setting A Technical Target Level

A good presentation should target a specific Python level and audience.

Presentations on *solving the performance issue by releasing the GIL when the C code block is executed using Cython* to beginner/intermediate audience might not be  appropriate.
Conversely, *an introduction to Cython* or *a description of a GIL* is not appropriate presentation for advanced users.

In order to prevent such ambiguity in the definition of Python level and audience, here is a simple guideline to determine the target level.

#### Beginner

The presentation topics for beginner level include the experience of learning Python, and the Python programming skills needed to become an intermediate user.
The contents of packages other than Python native built-in packages such as SciPy or Django are not suitable for beginners.

#### Intermediate

Intermediate user knows at least how to write Python program fluently and would like to seek for some advancement in writing Python application.
Possible topics that might interests intermediate level, such as web framework usage, machine learning, web traffic monitoring, and automation.

#### Advanced User

Advanced Users are familiar with Python technology and well-versed in general programming concepts, perhaps in improving/optimizing the performance of python standard library, or might currently maintaining essential Python libraries.

Presentation topics for advanced levels include optimization, the internal behavior of the tool, or an internal implementation of Python, or the implentation CPython and PyPi in Python libraries.
