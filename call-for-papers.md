* Submit Date: 03 April 2023
* Closing Date: 08 May 2023

## Speak in PyCon MY 2023

We want **YOU** in our PyCon.

~~Share with us your cool hacks, the Python-related projects that you are working on or your experience on the learning journey of Python programming.~~

Share with us your cool hacks, Python-related projects, or your experience at learning Python!
Our active and friendly community of Python developers at Malaysia are excited to hear from you.

We are excited to see the rise of adoption of Python in Malaysia and we hope that this conference will help further promote its use in the region.
We believe that sharing knowledge and ideas is the key to growth and innovation.

Join us in this exciting event and be part of the community that drives innovation in Python development!

## Topics for PyCon MY 2023

We welcome any Python related topics for the conference.
Here's a list of suggestions as a starter, but creative topics are extra welcomed.

* Data science
* Machine learning
* Usage in educating
* Networking
* Cybersecurity
* System administration
* Web development
* Automation
* Testing
* DevOps
  * Containerization
  * Cloud orchestration
  * Continuous integration / Continuous deployment
* Community / Open-Source for Python
* Python black magic or new features

We accept two kinds of talks, **Talks** and **Lightning Talks**.
Talks are 30 minutes long, while Lightning Talks are 5 to 10 minutes long.
Please note that the duration of the session includes setup and Q&A.

Talks can be given in either **English** or **Bahasa Malaysia**.

## General Guidelines

In order to submit a successful proposal, we would like to share some proposal guidelines to increase the chance of acceptance.

These are the criteria that we will use to evaluate your proposal:

* Topic
* Target Audience
* Audience take-away
* Your session time organization

Your proposal should include:

* Title
* Category
* Language
* Abstract
* Objectives

These are optional fields for a proposal:

* Detailed Description
* Outline
* Supplementary
* Code repository link (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

The optional fields are not required, but we encourage you to fill them up as much as possible.
These would help our reviewers to understand your proposal better.

Some of the fields are for reviewers only, so donâ€™t worry about spoilers:

* Objectives
* Outline
* Supplementary

## Proposal Review Process

The PyCon selection process generally begins after the call for proposal.
After considering on timing and geographical aspect, we will have the selection process based on a **[ROLLING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_admission)** basis.
If your proposal is interesting, we would like admit you early so that you have time to prepare, both presentation and transportation.

### Selection process

As the CFP will be conducted through [Papercall.io](https://papercall.io), there are few stages in reviewing your proposal:

1. Stage 1: The reviewer will review and give feedback for your proposal.
2. Stage 2: You review and modify your proposal
3. Stage 3: The reviewer will review your modified proposal again and decide if you are suitable for the talk.

## How to set target level

A good presentation is an appropriate presentation for a specific Python level and audience.
Presentation on *solving the performance issue by releasing the GIL when the C code block is executed using Cython* to beginner/intermediate audience might not be  appropriate.
Conversely, *an introduction to Cython* or *a description of a GIL* is not appropriate presentation for advanced users.

In order to prevent such ambiguity in the definition of Python level and audience, we would like to offer you a simple guideline for those who cannot determine the target level.

### Beginner

The presentation topics for beginner level include the experience of learning Python, and the Python programming skills needed to become an intermediate user.
The contents of packages other than Python native built-in packages such as SciPy or Django are not suitable for beginners.

### Intermediate User

Intermediate user knows at least how to write Python program fluently and would like to seek for some advancement in writing Python application.
Possible topics that might interests intermediate level, such as web framework usage, machine learning, web traffic monitoring, and automation.

### Advanced User

Advanced Users are familiar with Python technology and well-versed in general programming concepts, perhaps in improving/optimizing the performance of python standard library, or might currently maintaining essential Python libraries.

Presentation topics for advanced levels include optimization, the internal behavior of the tool, or an internal implementation of Python, or the implentation CPython and PyPy in Python libraries.
